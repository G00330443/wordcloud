Yaya Toure is lining up a 30 yarder...

No he isn't. Kevin de Bruyne hits the free kick instead and it is slap, bang at the Everton wall.

Into the last 20.

Great one-two between Kevin de Bruyne and Sergio Aguero, before the former sees a curling low shot from 20 yards well turned away by Joel Robles.

Jesus Navas is still upset he didn't get a penalty after tumbling inside the penalty area in the previous attack.

Leighton Baines whips the ball in from the left and that is is great defending by Martin Demichelis, who diverts the ball away from the waiting Romelu Lukaku.

A bit more solidity for Everton.

Gerard Deulofeu gets a deserved ovation from the home fans as he is replaced by Kevin Mirallas.

Fresh legs as he takes the vacant slot in right midfield.

Ross Barkley is strong. Nicolas Otamendi isn't,

The Everton midfielder leaves the defender on his backside as he races in on goal down the left side.

A sign of City coming back into it?

Fernandinho towers about Everton's defence but can only head down and into the hands of Joel Robles.

Two good chances within a couple of minutes.

Sergio Aguero should score.

Jesus Navas's cross is blocked but the loose ball is brilliantly collected with a drag by the striker.
